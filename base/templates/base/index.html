<h2> Factsheets </h2>
<br>
The present fact sheets were developed following the requirement to ameliorate the transparency of models and their outputs as well as the reproducibility of scenarios. We want to give an overview about the existing models to modelers and other interested stakeholders of energy system modelling. And we want to provide the base to discuss various scenarios. <br>
<br>
In several workshops with a lot of discussions as well as online-communication 3 fact sheets were developed: for models, frameworks and scenarios. They consist of general information, which are a kind of “must” for every factsheet and further information about openness, software and so on. We had long dicussions about how and where to put the data used for the calculations and decided that they shouldn’t be in the factsheets but if they are openly available a link should be included.<br>
<br>
Feel free to add your model/framework and the scenarios you want to talk about<br>
<br>
If you think that the factsheets could be better you can add your comments by using the discussion-site of the <a href="http://wiki.openmod-initiative.org/wiki/Fact_sheets_for_models,_frameworks_and_scenarios">openmod-wiki page</a> using the topic that you want to comment (e.g.: you want to add something to the categorie "openness" on the model factsheet than please use the topic  "MF - openness").
